To execute a script from this folder, call it like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ uv run ./scripts/create_some_stuff.py

The environment variable pointing to the configuration file,
``BYCEPS_CONFIG_FILE``, should be made available by putting it and its
value in the ``.env`` file (see documentation of native BYCEPS
installation on how to do that).
