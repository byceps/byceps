Obtain BYCEPS
=============

Grab a copy of BYCEPS itself. For now, the best way probably is to
clone the Git repository from GitHub:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/byceps/byceps.git

A new directory, ``byceps``, should have been created.

This way, it should be easy to pull in future updates to BYCEPS using
Git. (And there currently are no release tarballs anyway.)
