Obtain BYCEPS
=============

Grab a copy of BYCEPS itself. For now, the best way probably is to
clone the Git repository from GitHub:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/byceps/byceps.git

A new directory, :file:`byceps/`, should have been created.

This way, it should be easy to pull in future updates to BYCEPS using
Git. (And there currently are no release tarballs anyway.)

Now change into the newly created directory, as most of the following
commands must be run from there:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd byceps
