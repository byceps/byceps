Database Migrations
===================

Adjustments and new features sometimes require changes to the database
structure.

Those changes usually come in two forms:

1. DDL statements to change the structure of one or more tables,
   sometimes accompanied by SQL statements that add or adjust data.

   Use an SQL client (like PostgreSQL's `psql` command-line utility)
   connected to the BYCEPS database to execute those statements.

2. Calling the :ref:`create-database-tables <Create Database Tables>`
   command again which will then create new tables as necessary.

.. tip:: Consider updating BYCEPS regularly to keep the number of
   database migrations that need to be applied low.

To learn which migrations need to be applied, follow the channel
"db-changelog" on the BYCEPS Discord server.
