BYCEPS is the Bring-Your-Computer Event Processing System.

It is **a tool to prepare and operate a LAN party**, both online on the
Internet and locally as an intranet system, for both organizers and
attendees.

The system incorporates experience from almost 25 years of organizing
LAN parties as well as concepts and source code developed for more than
a decade.
